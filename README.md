I started trying to use the previous project as a reference point. It didn't work for me...at all. So, I scratched that idea, got the literal white board out to draw out the sections of my web page. After I had it physically in front of me, I was able to block out the sections of my web page to organize each "box". I wrote out the sample code, then in put the code into VS code. The christmas break was NOT kind to my memory. But, we are getting there.
